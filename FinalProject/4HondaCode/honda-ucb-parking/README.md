# Spring ‘19 Honda Parking Project: Team 18 

Park smarter in Columbus. 

## Quick Start for Web App Demo

Front End Demo is under final-demo/. To run demo locally, cd into final-demo and:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies. (Optionally beforehand, can use virtualenv and pip install in virtualenv. [More info on virtualenv from PythonAnywhere.](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Virtualenvs))

Then, to start Flask server:
```sh
python demo.py
```
Then navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) (or whichever url is displayed in terminal) to see the app.<br> 

If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/clarencelam2000/honda-ucb-parking/issues/new).
